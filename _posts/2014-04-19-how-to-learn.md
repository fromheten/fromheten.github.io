The feeling of having learned and mastered something really is one of the best there is, so I spend a lot of thought and effort to perfecting it. At the moment I'm learning the basics of Japanese, trying to keep my German (after moving), getting knee-deep in Clojure & Emacs, dabbling with econ theory and a handful of other things. 

I've found a workflow for studying that really, really works for me. 

##It's all about the input â†’ output

The learning starts with *discovering* information, followed by *understanding* and *learning*, followed by *storing* in memory. 

Just as important is being able to *retrieve* and *formulate* the information into something useful. 

When you have a deep understanding you will combine the information with other things. In this way *things learned is a compounding asset*. For every things you learn related to something you know, your knowledge output multiplies! 

##Tools I use to run the mind-machine
When I find something I want to learn I save it to my [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) or get a book on my [Kindle](https://kindle.amazon.com) or a paper book. If the weather allows I head out read it. I save Wikipedia articles, textbooks, blog posts, anything. 

To help understanding and storing the information I use [spaced repetition](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition), which is immensely powerful. It's learning taken to the next level. The information found I write as a question and explanation in [Anki](http://ankisrs.net). Explaining it to someone else, even just a text field (or better yet a flesh-and-bones human, or dog) works just like [rubber duck debugging](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/). Therefore it's important not to download one of the collections of 2000+ q&a's, but to type them yourself, only after you've understood them. 

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net) then keeps track of how well I remember things. Whenever I feel like I don't have anything to do (never true) I can just hit Anki get better. This is extraordinary for deep understanding and storing information in a retrievable way. Also, I have a small library on everything I've learned. 

##It's really that simple

* Find & learn information (from books, the web, conversations or imagination)
* Understanding it (with spaced repetition and practice)
* Storing it in a way that the deep understanding stays evergreen (with [Anki](http://ankisrs.net)'s spaced repetition)

This is what I do, and it makes me happy and makes my life better, so I recommend anyone to go for the same.
