App Stores today do paid apps in 3 ways. 

* One time-purchase (Tweetbot)
* Free app + IAP upgrades
* Free app with subscription happening outside of the app store. 

For the rest of the post: explore the economics of having a model where installing an app means 'subscribing' to it code. A program is more a stream of code than a product. Users would pay 1c/mo/app instead of 1$/â‚¬ one time. Devs would be happy, users when they understand the system.
